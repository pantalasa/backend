# DR Exercise — Backend API

## Scenario

Simulated complete loss of the primary database in us-east-1. The team walked through the recovery procedure to validate the documented steps and identify any gaps in the process.

## Recovery Steps Tested

1. Detected simulated outage via PagerDuty alert
2. Confirmed primary DB was unreachable using health check endpoints
3. Reviewed DR plan and identified failover procedure
4. Walked through manual failover steps to read replica
5. Verified application connectivity to failover target
6. Confirmed data integrity post-failover

## Participants

- Shane Miller (Engineering Lead)
- Dane Park (Senior Engineer)
- Simone Rivera (SRE)

## Lessons Learned

- Recovery steps were clear and actionable
- Team completed tabletop walkthrough within RTO target of 60 minutes
- Identified need to automate step 3 (failover initiation) for faster recovery
